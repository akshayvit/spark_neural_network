This is to show how distributed computing can be applied on reading datasets and running neural network on it.

We have used spark for showing the same.

U can test on hadoop too in your own way.

RDD is resilient distributed dataset.

The rdd_spark_nn.py shows a basic example of using this RDD data structure.

Thank you,
